## BCG Challenge

### About
Reports batching and handling are done asynchronously from performance perspectives.
There are two scheduled jobs:

- batchReportFolder - takes files from report folder, parse them and store.
- handleReports - converts the reports to target currency and calculates the gain.

There is one REST endpoint returns target song chart representation.

### Tech stack:
- Kotlin as a programming language
- Built by Gradle
- Spring Boot as framework
- Data structures as in-memory db simulation :)

### API
The app offers single REST API endpoint representing songs chart sorted by descending profit.

. Endpoint URI:

    /songs/charts

. Query parameter:

    "top" - define the size of generated chart. Default value: "5"

.Example schema:

    {
        "chart": [
            {
                "rank":1,
                "isrc":"G853C3770233",
                "trackName":"Let's Talk About Love",
                "artistName":"Primal Scream",
                "gain":"5,60 EUR"
            }
        ],
        "generatedAt":"2020-07-10T01:20:56.00787+02:00"
    }
